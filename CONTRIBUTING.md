Just, make sure your contributions adhere to my contribution policy and workflow, found below.

## Workflow

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch from `main` for your work. Use a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `fix-bug-issue-123` or `add-new-feature`).
3. **Make Your Changes**:
   - Open the JavaScript console for most of your debugging.
   - Use `console.log` statements to find and troubleshoot errors.
4. **Commit Your Changes**: Make clear and concise commit messages.
5. **Push to Your Branch**: Push your changes to your branch on GitHub.
6. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - **Description**: Fully describe the problem you found or the feature you want to add.

   - **Testing**: Indicate whether you tested your changes and how.
