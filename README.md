# Pentris - v2.0

Tetris, but with the pentominoes ðŸ˜Ž

## Play Now

Play `2.0` now at [plett.fun/pentris](https://plett.fun/pentris)

#### Controls

You can configure your controls in [settings](https://plett.fun/pentris/settings), and they'll save in your browser.

These are the default controls:

- **Arrow Keys** for piece movement horizontally and vertically.
- **A or D** to rotate.
- **W** to bank the piece for later.
- **Space** to reflect.

#### Gameplay

As you play Pentris, you'll realize it's very difficult to survive long without holes. Here's some tips if you're new.

- Start with a one-block-wide space on one side, for your long `I`s to go in and score maximal points.
- Practice looking ahead to upcoming pieces, and watch out for the extra difficult `X`s, `V`s, `Z`s, and `T`s.
- Don't forget pieces can go sideways! This is especially important for `Z`s and `T`s.
- Do your best to not create 2-squares-deep holes, as only a small subset of pieces can fill those.
- If you've got too many holes, abandon your space on the side and just start digging.

If you are an experienced player and want to maximize your score, you can start on later levels just like NES Tetris. This is configured in your [settings](https://plett.fun/pentris), which will be saved.
